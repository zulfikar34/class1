<p><b> Shane Keith Warne</b> (13 September 1969 – 4 March 2022) was an Australian international Hall of Fame cricketer who played from 1991 to 2007 as a right-arm leg spin bowler and a right-handed batsman for Victoria, Hampshire and Australia. He is widely acknowledged to have been one of the sport's greatest-ever bowlers. He made 145 Test appearances, taking 708 wickets.

    Warne's 708 Test wickets was the record for the most wickets taken by any bowler in Test cricket until 2007. A useful lower-order batsman, Warne scored more than 3,000 Test runs, with a highest score of 99. As well as playing internationally, Warne played domestic cricket in Australia and also for Hampshire in England. Warne retired from international cricket at the end of Australia's 2006–07 Ashes series victory over England.
    
    He played in the first four seasons of the Indian Premier League for the Rajasthan Royals, where he was a player-coach who also captained the team. During his career he was involved in scandals off the field, including a ban from cricket for testing positive for a prohibited substance, charges of bringing the game into disrepute and sexual indiscretions.
    
    Warne revolutionised cricket thinking with his mastery of leg spin, which had come to be regarded as a dying art. After retirement, he regularly worked as a cricket commentator. He also worked for charitable organisations and endorsed commercial products. In recognition of his skill, a statue of him bowling was placed outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He was also honoured at a state memorial service at the ground.
